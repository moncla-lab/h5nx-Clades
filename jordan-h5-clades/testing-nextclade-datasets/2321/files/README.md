## Scope of this dataset
This dataset uses a current H5 candidate vaccine virus (CVV) from clade `2.3.2.1` (A/duck/Vietnam/NCVD-1584/2012) as a reference and is suitable for the analysis of H5 sequences belonging to clade `2.3.2.1` and its sub-clades `2.3.2.1a` through `2.3.2.1g`. Sequences belonging to other clades cannot be annotated by this dataset and will be left `unassigned`.

## Features
This dataset supports

 * Assignment to clades and subclades based on the provisional nomenclature defined by the WHO/FAO/WOAH H5 Nomenclature Working Group
 * Sequence QC
 * Phylogenetic placement

## Clades of seasonal influenza viruses

The WHO/FAO/WOAH H5 Nomenclature Working Group define "clades" as genetically divergent groups of viruses, based on their HA gene segment.
Viruses falling into a given clade share a common ancestor with significant bootstrap support and have low levels of within-clade diversity.
When significant within-clade diversity is seen, these clades can be further split into sub-clades; for example, clade `2.3.2.1` is being split into eight additional sub-clades, named `2.3.2.1a` through `2.3.2.1g` due to high circulating diversity within the clade.
This Nextclade dataset incorporates these provisional `2.3.2.1` sub-clades.
